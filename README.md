# Recognition-of-English-Sign-Language
This project is mainly focused on the development and implementation of an embedded system for recognition of english sign language to aid deaf -mute people. The embedded system is supported on a Raspberry Pi board with a web camera and terminal display connected to it. The system runs on the open-source Linux flavor Ubuntu installed with Opencv image processing software. C++ is used as the programming language, and all the required opencv algorithms are used to compute the desired result. Using the data from the web-camera stored as
matrices, filtering is done to obtain an intermediate image with reduced noise. From this image, the training set of gestures are recorded. This information is used to compare with the test data to approximately guess the letter. Thus this embedded module records the hand signs and displays their corresponding English alphabet.
